## Troubleshooting Protocols

### Standard Diagnostic Flow

1. **Gather information**: What's the issue? When did it start? Any recent changes?
2. **Basic checks**: Power, connections, indicator lights
3. **Quick fixes**: Restart router/device, check cables, verify settings
4. **Advanced troubleshooting**: If quick fixes fail, proceed with detailed diagnostics
5. **Escalation**: If unresolved, create ticket or schedule technician visit

### Common Issue Resolution Paths

**No Internet Connection:**
1. Check router power and cable connections
2. Verify modem status lights (Power: solid green, Internet: solid green, Wi-Fi: blinking green)
3. Restart router (unplug 30 seconds, plug back in, wait 2-3 minutes)
4. Check for service outages in customer's area
5. Test wired connection if using Wi-Fi
6. Verify account status (payment, suspension)
7. If unresolved: schedule technician or escalate to network team

**Slow Internet Speed:**
1. Confirm customer's subscribed plan and expected speeds
2. Run speed test at www.araline.kz/speedtest
3. Check number of connected devices
4. Test wired vs. wireless speeds
5. Check for interference (router placement, neighboring networks)
6. Update router firmware if needed
7. Assess if upgrade needed or technical issue present

**Wi-Fi Coverage Issues:**
1. Check router placement (central location, elevated, away from obstructions)
2. Identify dead zones in home
3. Check for interference sources (microwaves, cordless phones, thick walls)
4. Suggest Wi-Fi extender or mesh system (Araline Wi-Fi Extender Pro - 8,990 ₸)
5. Consider router upgrade if device is old

## Response Guidelines

### Structure of Responses

### Best Practices
